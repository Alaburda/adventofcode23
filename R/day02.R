#' **Part One**
#'
#' You\'re launched high into the atmosphere! The apex of your trajectory
#' just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky.
#' You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It\'s quite cold, but you
#' don\'t see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.
#'
#' The Elf explains that you\'ve arrived at *Snow Island* and apologizes
#' for the lack of snow. He\'ll be happy to explain the situation, but
#' it\'s a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don\'t get many
#' visitors up here; [would you like to play a
#' game]{title="No, the Elf's name is not 'WOPR'. It's Joshua."} in the
#' meantime?
#'
#' As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are
#' either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a
#' secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to
#' figure out information about the number of cubes.
#'
#' To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will
#' reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you,
#' and then put them back in the bag. He\'ll do this a few times per game.
#'
#' You play several games and record the information from each game (your
#' puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the `11` in
#' `Game 11: ...`) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of
#' cubes that were revealed from the bag (like `3 red, 5 green, 4 blue`).
#'
#' For example, the record of a few games might look like this:
#'
#'     Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
#'     Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
#'     Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
#'     Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
#'     Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
#'
#' In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put
#' back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second
#' set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is
#' only 2 green cubes.
#'
#' The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if
#' the bag contained *only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue
#' cubes*?
#'
#' In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been *possible* if
#' the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would
#' have been *impossible* because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red
#' cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been *impossible*
#' because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs
#' of the games that would have been possible, you get *`8`*.
#'
#' Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been
#' loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. *What
#' is the sum of the IDs of those games?*
